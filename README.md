# fps-movement-unity

This is a first person player controller I made for Unity in C#. It uses rigidbody velocities for better hit detection and less clipping than transform.position. Feel free to use it if you'd like!

*Features*

- jumping
- walking
- sprinting
- crouching
- no slipperly movement
- slower movement while jumping for more realistic jumping
